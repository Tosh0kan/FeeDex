## Introduction
I made this project because I was tired of forgetting to check mangas, and given that the MangaDex team has far more pressing issues than implementing an RSS feed or push notification system, I decided to take matters into my own hands.

### State of Things
At the moment, this program is a roughish beta. I've tested it enough to make sure it works, but I haven't done any extensive bug search, so expect things to break.

### Getting Help
When problems do arise, create a bug report on the issues tab.
